# Financial Reporting and Analysis using SQL

## Project Description
Students will be given access (read-only) to an existing accounting database H_Accounting.

Students will need to build queries and insert results into tmp tables through a stored procedure to create the Profit and Loss (P&L) and Balance Sheet (B/S) statements. 

The stored procedure must achieve the following:

- Receive as an argument the year for which the user wants to produce the P&L and B/S statements
- Do the necessary calculations to obtain the net profit or loss for that year
- Use that value, to produce the B/S
- Demonstrate that A = L + E
- Print both the P&L and B/S as clear as possible on the Result Grids
- Show the % change vs. the previous year for every major line item on the P&L and B/S
- Give some headings to each major account line item. And to each section of the P&L and B/S
- Add any additional financial metrics and ratios that could be useful to analyze this start-up 
- Produce a cash flow statement  as an added challenge
- The stored procedure must have comprehensive comments explaining the purpose of each block of code

## Project Outcome
Developed comprehensive financial reports and performed in-depth analysis using SQL, enabling data-driven insights and informed decision-making for key stakeholders and executives.
